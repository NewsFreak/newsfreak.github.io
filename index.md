# NewsFreak

Many modern news apps are filled with useless features and sometimes confusing UI's. They curate the news feed, automatically select sources based on what it thinks you will like, and build their UI to keep you using their app.

NewsFreak changes this. NewsFreak doesn't curate your news feed, you do. NewsFreak doesn't select sources you might like, you do. Our app lets you decide what you want to read, rather than the other way around.

## Features

- Top Headlines from 100+ News Sources
 
- Search 30,000+ News Sources

- Granular control over sources that show up in your news feed.

- Free and Open Source
